## The Challenge
To refactor an existing webpage in order to make it accessible, so it optimized for search engines.

Acceptance criteria for the webpage:
- Meets accessibility standards
- Applies semantic HTML elements
- The elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Includes accessible alt attributes in images
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Includes a concise, descriptive title element

Additional requirements for long term sustainability:
- Ensure all links are functioning correctly
- Clean up the CSS selectors and properties to make it efficient
  - Consolidate CSS selectors and properties
  - Organize CSS selectors and properties to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
  - Include comments before each element or section of the page
